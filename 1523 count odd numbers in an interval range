/*It is very easy to find total odd numbers in the given interval range as we know there are almost half even and half odd numbers in an interval range.
But we have to consider the interval boundaries very carefully. So what we can do is we can form the formula for the count of odd numbers in first n natural numbers. Let it be count[n]. Then odd numbers between low and high will be equal to :
count[ low, high ] = count[high] â€“ count[low-1].
0---------------3(low)-----7(high)----------
---------------------------length of high
---------------low-1-------count[low,high]

public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) 
    {
           return (high+1)/2 - low/2;
